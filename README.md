#  Learning Rule-Based Expert Systems Using Python ACT-R

## Assignment Description
#### The primary goal of this assignment is to create an intelligent ["Roomba"](https://www.irobot.com/roomba) robot that can intelligently navigate through a finite virtual 2D space. The main idea is to use [Python ACT-R](https://sites.google.com/site/pythonactr/) to specify behaviors that the Roomba should use in certain situations. [These include spiraling, bouncing, and wall-following.](https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/appliance-science-how-robotic-vacuums-navigate/#) The code for this portion of the assignment is in [vacuum.py](https://github.com/shane-staret/AI-Vacuum-Bucknell-CSCI-357/blob/master/vacuum.py).
#### Another part of this assignment is to build a program with Python ACT-R that effectively creates a (virtual and non-visual) sandwich from the bottom up. This is a simple part of the assignment and is used to demonstrate how rules can be created using Python ACT-R. The code for this portion of the assignment is in [sandwich.py](https://github.com/shane-staret/AI-Vacuum-Bucknell-CSCI-357/blob/master/sandwich.py).

<!--
## Getting the Code Running
#### 1) Install a [version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) between 3.3-3.7.
#### 2) Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shane-staret/AI-Vacuum-Bucknell-CSCI-357.git`
#### 3) Navigate to the main Python files (from the directory this repo was cloned into): `cd AI-Vacuum-Bucknell-CSCI-357`
#### 4a) To run the Roomba program, type `python vacuum.py` in the terminal.
#### 4b) To run the sandwich building program, type `python sandwich.py` in the terminal.
