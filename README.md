#  Learning Rule-Based Expert Systems Using Python ACT-R | Kevin Doyle & Shane Staret

## Assignment Description
#### The primary goal of this assignment is to create an intelligent ["Roomba"](https://www.irobot.com/roomba) robot that can intelligently navigate through a finite virtual 2D space. The main idea is to use [Python ACT-R](https://sites.google.com/site/pythonactr/) to specify behaviors that the Roomba should use in certain situations. [These include spiraling, bouncing, and wall-following.](https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/appliance-science-how-robotic-vacuums-navigate/#) The code for this portion of the assignment is in [vacuum.py](https://gitlab.bucknell.edu/krd008/csci357-sp21a/blob/master/vacuum.py).
#### Another part of this assignment is to build a program with Python ACT-R that effectively creates a (virtual and non-visual) sandwich from the bottom up. This is a simple part of the assignment and is used to demonstrate how rules can be created using Python ACT-R. The code for this portion of the assignment is in [sandwich.py](https://gitlab.bucknell.edu/krd008/csci357-sp21a/blob/master/sandwich.py).

## Getting the Code Running
#### 1) Install a version of Python between 3.3-3.7.
#### 2) Download this repository.
#### 3) Navigate to ~/csci357-sp21a in your terminal.
#### 4a) To run the Roomba program, type `python vacuum.py` in the terminal.
#### 4b) To run the sandwich building program, type `python sandwich.py` in the terminal.

## Issues
#### We were able to nail down the spiral pattern for the Roomba, however, we were not completely able to implement the wall bouncing and then straight pattern behavior. We mostly were able to replicate it and the Roomba acts quite intelligently, however, we do not believe these behaviors were implemented as intended. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
